# Passolo API Documentation #
Passolo is a localization tool that enables you to translate the user interfaces of software applications. You can find all the information about working with the Passolo API in the [RWS documentation portal](https://docs.rws.com/881527/453416/sdl-passolo-automation/about-sdl-passolo-automation). You may find there is some lag in rendering the pages to this documentation, please be patient. The plan is to move it to this site in the near future.
## What does the Passolo API cover? ##
### [Scripting and Automation](https://docs.rws.com/881527/453429/sdl-passolo-automation/scripting-and-automation) ###
Scripting and Automation are powerful concepts to customize applications and integrate applications so that they work together like one single application.
### [COM - Some background](https://docs.rws.com/881527/453434/sdl-passolo-automation/com-some-background) ###
Using Sax Basic effectively requires that you should have a basic understanding of COM, component based computing and the Passolo Object Model. COM (the Component Object Model) is a binary standard for interfacing and interoperation of (possibly, separately-developed) components. More and more, everything Microsoft offers is COM-compliant.
### [Automation of Passolo](https://docs.rws.com/881527/580722/sdl-passolo-automation/automation-of-sdl-passolo) ###
You can automate Passolo from any programming language that is able to connect to automation servers. Using automation, Passolo can be integrated into workflow management systems. Nearly every operation which is normally performed by a user can be automated without human interaction.
### [Using Macros in Passolo](https://docs.rws.com/881527/453450/sdl-passolo-automation/using-macros-in-passolo) ###
Instead of using an external programming development tool, you can also use the scripting engine embedded in Passolo. The scripting engine is VBA compatible and includes an editor and a debugger.
### [The System Macro](https://docs.rws.com/881527/453473/sdl-passolo-automation/the-system-macro) ###
In the dialog Macro you can select one of the available macros as the system macro. When you start the system macro with the command Tools / System Macro / Start System Macro this macro will be active all the time. When you work with Passolo some of the actions you perform will issue events. If the related call back handlers are defined in the system macro, these events can be processed.
### [Automating other applications from Passolo](https://docs.rws.com/881527/453478/sdl-passolo-automation/automating-other-applications-from-passolo) ###
In order to use another application in a Passolo macro, you should add a reference to the object.
### [What's new in Passolo Automation](https://docs.rws.com/881527/453487/sdl-passolo-automation/what-s-new-in-sdl-passolo-automation) ###
This page contains the latest changes made to Passolo Automation.
### [Getting help](https://docs.rws.com/881527/453496/sdl-passolo-automation/getting-help) ###
After having understood the basic principle of the object model, all you have to do is obtain some information about the names of all the objects and what properties and methods they have. This getting help section will explain how this is done.
